A bespoke archival box was made to protect the rebound manuscript in storage.  The handholds in the plinth on which the book rests are designed to promote easy safe handling of this heavy book.  The remains of the old binding are housed with the manuscript in an archival folder.

The box is covered with linen buckram, a durable cloth which adds its strength to the structure of the box.
